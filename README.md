# Simple To-Do List Project

## Description
This to-do list aims to help anyone organize what they need to do into small lists that are easy to read ! ヾ(≧▽≦*)o
This to-do list also helps anyone understand the importance of arrays, lopps, etc.

## How does it work?
1. Starts an infinite loop – while True: keeps the program running until the user chooses to exit.
2. Shows a menu – The program prints options like Add, Remove, Edit, Show, or End.
3. Takes user input – The user types a number to select an action.
4. Adds to-dos – If the user chooses to add, it asks how many tasks (1–3), then appends each to the todo_list.
5. Removes or edits items – It lists current tasks and lets the user remove or change one by specifying its number.
6. Displays the list – Shows all current to-dos in order with numbering.
7. Ends the program – Choosing 5 breaks the loop and exits.
8. Handles errors – The program checks for invalid inputs and numbers outside the allowed range to prevent crashes.

Basically, it keeps a list in memory and lets the user add, remove, edit, or view items, all through simple numbered menus.
